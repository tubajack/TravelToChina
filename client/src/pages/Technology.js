        <h2>History of Technology in China</h2>   

        <p>
          Up until the Qing dynasty, China was a world leader in science and technology.
          Many innovations including papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder contributed to 
          the rapid economic development in Europe and Asia at that time.

          One of the oldest longstanding contributions of the Ancient Chinese is traditional medicine. 
          Acupuncture is one of the most well-known components of Chinese medicine. It is most often
          used for pain relief, but can be used for other conditions. It is generally used with other forms
          of treatment.

          The Chinese also invented counting and time-keeping devices. About 4000 years ago, shadow clocks, 
          (precursor to sundial), first appeared in China. Between 1000 and 500 BC, the abacus was invented in China.
          In 2137 BC, the Chinese were able to record the first solar eclipse, and in 500 BC, they were able to 
          record the first planetary grouping. The Book of Silk was written in 400 BC, and it was 
          the first atlas of comets, listing 29 comets appearing over 300 years.

          One of the most well-known technological feats in China is the Great Wall of China. 
          The Great Wall of China was built to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese states
          and empires against nomadic groups. As early as the 7th century BC, several walls were being built. 
          Some of these stretches were joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220-206 BC). The mst currenty well-known
          walls were built by the Ming Dynasty.
